Hey, I'm Physix, I'm 16 and I'm not sure what 
I want to do when I'm older, but something in tech,
whether its tech consulting, software engineering or something in AI.

Currently I live in the UK, but I plan to move to the Middle
East in the future.

I'm also a Muslim :)

If anyone has any tips or anything, then please feel free to message me or something :)
